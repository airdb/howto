Hi Everyone:
We will be having a meeting next Friday from 2:00pm - 3:00pm in Room 3. All supervisors are expected to attend. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the upcoming tourist season.
As you probably have heard, this could be our busiest season to date. There are already 20 bus tours booked from China, and 15 walking tours booked from North America.</description></item><item><title>Check Answer with Your Partner</title><link>https://www.airdb.com/howto/academy/en/check-answer-with-your-partner/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.airdb.com/howto/academy/en/check-answer-with-your-partner/</guid><description>Check Answer with Your Partner # Email Example # What did you get for ?
